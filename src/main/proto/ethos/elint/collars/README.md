## Introduction

**Ethos Domain Collars** are an essential part of the 50GRAMx vision, designed to standardize and streamline domain recognition across multiple portfolios such as knowledge, service, product, or things. Each collar reserves a unique domain within the Ethos universe, supporting identification, ownership, and publication rights for various communities within GRAMx.

**GRAMx Communities** hold a reserve of **0.5 Billion Domain Collars** each. This reserve can be utilized to recognize and publish information on behalf of the community, with each domain collar’s unique code name reflecting the community and the number of collars used from the reserve.

## Collar’s Code Name Explanation

Each domain collar has a **Code Name** that includes two main parts:

1. **Community Code**: Identifies the community to which the collar belongs.
2. **Reserve Used**: Displays the total number of collars used from the 0.5 billion collar reserve.

For example:
- **50DC-500000000**
  - Community Code: `50`
  - Reserve Used: `500,000,000`

## Code Name Extensibility (Alternatives)

To support flexibility in marketing and branding, domain collars can have alternative names based on **Roman Numeral Extensibility**. This allows multiple, recognizable names for the same collar, providing creative ways to reference and promote each domain.

**Example of Roman Numeral Conversion**:
- **50DC-D.M:000**
  - Community Code: `50`
  - Reserve Used (converted): `500,000,000`

**Conversion Method**:
- Roman numerals before the colon (:) are converted to numeric values separated by dots (e.g., `D` is 500, `M` is 1000, so `D.M` is `500.1000`).
- Replace dots and colons with commas, resulting in `500,1000,000`.
- Standardize with three-digit groups, yielding `500,000,000`.

## Recognized Collars

Some example collars for reference:

| Collar Code            | Alternative Code         | Community | Galaxy     |
|------------------------|--------------------------|-----------|------------|
| 50DC-500000000         | 50DC-D.M:000             | 50GRAMx   | Galaxy 1   |
| 50DC-499999999         | 50DC-CDXCIX.CMXCIX:999   | 50GRAMx   | Galaxy 2   |

## How to Build Collars for Ethos Domains

Building a collar for a specific domain involves setting up a domain reserve for one of the main portfolios (Knowledge, Service, Product, Things). Follow these steps:

1. **Define Community Code**: Choose a code that represents the community the collar will belong to.
2. **Specify Reserve Used**: Determine the reserve count needed for the collar (up to 0.5 billion per community).
3. **Assign Code Name**: Use the format `CommunityCode-ReserveUsed`, e.g., `50DC-500000000`.
4. **Optionally Apply Roman Numeral Extensibility**:
   - Convert part of the reserve to a Roman numeral form if alternative naming is required.
   - Follow the Roman numeral conversion steps provided above.

To build specific collars for each Ethos Domain, please refer to the following README files:
